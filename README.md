# About this repo

This is the archive of my codes for my project of the 2110597 Pattern Recognition course at Chulalongkorn University, which I have done about classification of dog breed (based on [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification))

The code are all in Jupyter notebook, divided into custom model (which I've written by myself and mostly consist of simple NNs) and model based on transfer learning, which all of them are self-runnable and consisting of data preprocessing, model training, and model inference on test data (The result from inference on test data is then submitted to Kaggle for evaluation).
